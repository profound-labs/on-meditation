Ajahn Chah (or Luang Por Chah) was a famous teacher in the Thai forest tradition of Theravada Buddhism. Born in 1917 in the province of Ubon Rachathani in north-east Thailand, he ordained as a monk in his early twenties. Ajahn Chah spent the rest of his life in the robes, practising, and later teaching the Dhamma to both Thais and foreigners.

This small booklet is a selection of some of his teachings dealing specifically with meditation practice. It contains edited extracts from various talks already translated and published over the years. The extracts have been put together following a general pattern of preliminary instructions, deepening one's meditation and cultivating insight. As it is a compilation of teachings there is a certain amount of repetition, but this in itself was a feature of Ajahn Chah's style, emphasizing key themes again and again throughout his years of teaching. We hope it helps bring to life some of the wisdom of this much loved meditation master.
